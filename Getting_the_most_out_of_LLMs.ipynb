        "# Getting the most out of LLMs\n",
        "\n",
        "Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT3/4, [Falcon](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-40b), and [LLama](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-hf) are rapidly advancing in their ability to tackle human-centric tasks, establishing themselves as essential tools in modern knowledge-based industries.\n",
        "Deploying these models in real-world tasks remains challenging, however:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   To exhibit near-human text understanding and generation capabilities, LLMs currently require to be composed of billions of parameters (see [Kaplan et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361), [Wei et. al](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07682)). This consequently amplifies the memory demands for inference.\n",
        "-   In many real-world tasks, LLMs need to be given extensive contextual information. This necessitates the model's capability to manage very long input sequences during inference.\n",
        "\n",
        "The crux of these challenges lies in augmenting the computational and memory capabilities of LLMs, especially when handling expansive input sequences.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this blog post, we will go over the most effective techniques to tackle these challenges for efficient LLM deployment:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Lower Precision**: Research has shown that operating at reduced numerical precision, namely 8-bit and 4-bit, can achieve computational advantages without a considerable decline in model performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Flash Attention:** Flash Attention is a variation of the attention algorithm that not only provides a more memory-efficient approach but also realizes increased efficiency due to optimized GPU memory utilization.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Architectural Innovations:** Considering that LLMs are always deployed in the same way during inference, namely autoregressive text generation with a long input context, specialized model architectures have been proposed that allow for more efficient inference. The most important advancement in model architectures hereby are [Alibi](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12409), [Rotary embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.09864), [Multi-Query Attention (MQA)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02150) and [Grouped-Query-Attention (GQA)]((https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13245)).\n",
        "\n",
        "Throughout this notebook, we will offer an analysis of auto-regressive generation from a tensor's perspective. We delve into the pros and cons of adopting lower precision, provide a comprehensive exploration of the latest attention algorithms, and discuss improved LLM architectures. While doing so, we run practical examples showcasing each of the feature improvements.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1. Harnessing the Power of Lower Precision\n",
        "\n",
        "Memory requirements of LLMs can be best understood by seeing the LLM as a set of weight matrices and vectors and the text inputs as a sequence of vectors. In the following, the definition *weights* will be used to signify all model weight matrices and vectors.\n",
        "\n",
        "At the time of writing this paper, LLMs consist of at least a couple billion parameters. Each parameter thereby is made of a decimal number, e.g. `4.5689` which is usually stored in either [float32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-precision_floating-point_format), [bfloat16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bfloat16_floating-point_format), or [float16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-precision_floating-point_format) format. This allows us to easily compute the memory requirement to load the LLM into memory:\n",
        "\n",
        "> *Loading the weights of a model having X billion parameters requires roughly 4 * X GB of VRAM in float32 precision*\n",
        "\n",
        "Nowadays, models are however rarely trained in full float32 precision, but usually in bfloat16 precision or less frequently in float16 precision. Therefore the role of thumb becomes:\n",
        "\n",
        "> *Loading the weights of a model having X billion parameters requires roughly 2 * X GB of VRAM in bfloat16/float16 precision*\n",
        "\n",
        "For shorter text inputs (less than 1024 tokens), the memory requirement for inference is very much dominated by the memory requirement to load the weights. Therefore, for now, let's assume that the memory requirement for inference is equal to the memory requirement to load the model into the GPU VRAM.\n",
        "\n",
        "To give some examples of how much VRAM it roughly takes to load a model in bfloat16:\n",
        "\n",

        "As of writing this document, the largest GPU chip on the market is the A100 offering 80GB of VRAM. Most of the models listed before require more than 80GB just to be loaded and therefore necessarily require [tensor parallelism](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.15.0/parallelism#tensor-parallelism) and/or [pipeline parallelism](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.15.0/parallelism#naive-model-parallel-vertical-and-pipeline-parallel)\n",

        "\n",
        "Today's top-performing LLMs share more or less the same fundamental architecture that consists of feed-forward layers, activation layers, layer normalization layers, and most crucially, self-attention layers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Self-attention layers are central to Large Language Models (LLMs) in that they enable the model to understand the contextual relationships between input tokens.\n",
        "However, the peak GPU memory consumption for self-attention layers grows *quadratically* both in time and memory complexity with number of input tokens (also called *sequence length*) that we denote in the following by $N$.\n",
        "While this is not really noticeable for shorter input sequences (of up to 1000 input tokens), it becomes a serious problem for longer input sequences (at around 16000 input tokens).\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's take a closer look. The formula to compute the output $\\mathbf{O}$ of a self-attention layer for an input $\\mathbf{X}$ of length $N$ is:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ \\textbf{O} = \\text{Attn}(\\mathbf{X}) = \\mathbf{V} \\times \\text{Softmax}(\\mathbf{QK}^T) \\text{ with } \\mathbf{Q} = \\mathbf{W}_q \\mathbf{X}, \\mathbf{V} = \\mathbf{W}_v \\mathbf{X}, \\mathbf{K} = \\mathbf{W}_k \\mathbf{X} $$\n",

        "$\\mathbf{X} = (\\mathbf{x}_1, ... \\mathbf{x}_{N})$ is thereby the input sequence to the attention layer. The projections $\\mathbf{Q}$ and $\\mathbf{K}$ will each consist of $N$ vectors resulting in the $\\mathbf{QK}^T$ being of size $N^2$.\n",
        "\n",
        "LLMs usually have multiple attention heads, thus doing multiple self-attention computations in parallel.\n",
        "Assuming, the LLM has 40 attention heads and runs in bfloat16 precision, we can calculate the memory requirement to store the $\\mathbf{QK^T}$ matrices to be $40 * 2 * N^2$ bytes. For $N=1000$ only around 50 MB of VRAM are needed, however, for $N=16000$ we would need 19 GB of VRAM, and for $N=100,000$ we would need  almost 1TB just to store the $\\mathbf{QK}^T$ matrices.\n",
        "\n",
        "Long story short, the default self-attention algorithm quickly becomes prohibitively memory-expensive for large input contexts.\n",
        "\n",
        "As LLMs improve in text comprehension and generation, they are applied to increasingly complex tasks. While models once handled the translation or summarization of a few sentences, they now manage entire pages, demanding the capability to process extensive input lengths.\n",
        "\n",
        "How can we get rid of the exorbitant memory requirements for large input lengths? We need a new way to compute the self-attention mechanism that gets rid of the $QK^T$ matrix. [Tri Dao et al.](FlashAttention:%20Fast%20and%20Memory-Efficient%20Exact%20Attention%20with%20IO-Awareness) developed exactly such a new algorithm and called it **Flash Attention**.\n",
        "\n",
        "In a nutshell, Flash Attention breaks the $ \\mathbf{V} \\times \\text{Softmax}(\\mathbf{QK}^T) $ computation apart and instead computes smaller chunks of the output by iterating oven multiple softmax computation steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ \\textbf{O}_i \\leftarrow s^a_{ij} * \\textbf{O}_i + s^b_{ij} * \\mathbf{V}_{j} \\times \\text{Softmax}(\\mathbf{QK}^T_{i,j}) \\text{ for multiple } i, j \\text{ iterations} $$\n",
        "\n",
        "with $s^a_{ij}$ and $s^b_{ij}$ being some softmax normalization statistics that need to be recomputed for every $i$ and $j$.\n",
        "\n",
        "Please note that the whole Flash Attention is a bit more complex and is greatly simplified here as going in too much depth is out of scope for this notebook. The reader is invited to take a look at the well-written [Flash Attention paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.14135.pdf) for more details.\n",
        "\n",
        "The main takeaway here is:\n",
        "\n",
        "> By keeping track of softmax normalization statistics and by using some smart mathematics, Flash Attention gives **numerical identical** outputs compared to the default self-attention layer at a memory cost that only increases linearly with $N$.\n",
        "\n",
        "Looking at the formula, one would intuitively say that Flash Attention must be much slower compared to the default self-attention formula as more computation needs to be done. Indeed Flash Attention requires more FLOPs compared to normal attenion as the softmax normalization statistics have to constantly be recomputed (see [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.14135.pdf) for more details if interested)\n",
        "\n",
        "> However Flash Attenion is much faster in inference compared to default attention which comes from its ability to significantly reduce the demands on the slower, high-bandwidth memory of the GPU (VRAM), focusing instead on the faster on-chip memory (SRAM).\n",
        "\n",
        "Essentially, Flash Attention makes sure that all intermediate write and read operations can be done using the fast *on-chip* SRAM memory instead of having to access the slower VRAM memory to compute the output vector $\\mathbf{O}$.\n",
        "\n",
        "In practice, there is currently absolutely no reason to **not** use Flash Attention if available. The algorithm gives mathematically the same outputs, and is both faster and more memory-efficient.\n",

For long text inputs, it is advantageous if the model learns the relative positional distance input input tokens have to each other instead of their absolute position.\n",
        "-   2.) When using learned position embeddings, the LLM has to be trained on a fixed input length $N$, which makes it difficult to extrapolate to an input length longer than what it was trained on.\n",

        "Without going into too many details, *RoPE* notes that positional information can be encoded into query-key pairs, *e.g.* $\\mathbf{q}_i$ and $\\mathbf{x}_j$ by rotating each vector by an angle $\\theta * i$ and $\\theta * j$ respectively with $i, j$ describing each vectors sentence position:\n",

However, the community has found a couple of effective tricks that adapt $\\theta$, thereby allowing *RoPE* position embeddings to work well for extrapolated text input sequences (see [here](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/24653)).\n",

        " -   The LLM should be incentivized to learn a constant *relative* distance positional encodings have to each other\n",
        " -   The further text input tokens are from each other, the lower the probability of their query-value probability.

As the title says, Noam found out that instead of using `n_head` key-value projections weights, one can use a single head-value projection weight pair that is shared across all attention heads without that the model's performance significantly degrades.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "As most LLMs use between 20 and 100 attention heads, MQA significantly reduces the memory consumption of the key-value cache. For the LLM used in this notebook we could therefore reduce the required memory consumption from 15 GB to less than 400 MB at an input sequence length of 16000.\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition to memory savings, MQA also leads to improved computational efficiency as explained in the following.\n",
        "In auto-regressive decoding, large key-value vectors need to be reloaded, concatenated with the current key-value vector pair to be then fed into the $\\mathbf{q}_c\\mathbf{K}^T$ computation at every step. For auto-regressive decoding, the required memory bandwidth for the constant reloading can become a serious time bottleneck. By reducing the size of the key-value vectors less memory needs to be accessed, thus reducing the memory bandwidth bottleneck. For more detail, please have a look into [Noam's paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02150).\n",

        "The important part to understand here is that reducing the number of key-value attention heads to 1 only makes sense if a key-value cache is used. The peak memory consumption of the model for a single forward pass without key-value cache stays unchanged as every attention head still has a unique query vector so that each attention head still has a different $\\mathbf{QK}^T$ matrix.\n",

The paper argues that more model performance can be kept by less drastically reducing the number of query head projection weights. Instead of using just a single key-value projection weight, `n < n_head` key-value projection weights should be used. By choosing `n` to a significantly smaller value than `n_head`, such as 2,4 or 8 almost all of the memory and speed gains from MQA can be kept while sacrificing less model capacity and thus arguably less performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Moreover, the authors of GQA found out that existing model checkpoints can be *uptrained* to have a GQA architecture with as little as 5% of the original pre-training compute. While 5% of the original pre-training compute can still be a massive amount, GQA *uptraining* allows existing checkpoints to be useful for longer input sequences.\n",
